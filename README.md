Made in ~4 hours because I saw a cool YouTubevideo about it and wanted to make a copy of what the person made. I optimized it because they were going a little slow. I think they were redrawing the whole screen every time, whereas I only redraw the new cells during the solving stage. Use this to set up your workspace if you'd like:

#python -m venv venv
#.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
#pip install pygame

Run from main.py
